# fake-news-classification-countvectorizer
Fake news classification using CountVectorizer for pre processing and MultinomialNB and PassiveAggressiveClassifier
This project kaggle fakenews data to develop a model which classfies whether a news is fake news or not
In this project I considered only title rather than the text of news as taking text of news would require huge computing requirements.
CountVectorizer is used fr vectorization
MultinomialNB, PassiveAggressiveClassifier are used for classifying the news
Hyper parameter tuning is done through iteration of alpha over a range
